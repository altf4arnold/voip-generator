# VOIP Config Maker
VOIP Phones are generally integrated in an ecosystem that autogenerate the config for them.
Making them by hand can be tedious and is a reason why those perfectly functional phones end up to waste although they are still capable after their EOL. Too much time and research required.

# Documentation :
Templates and doc are available in the phone folder's.

You will find links for config in LINK.md in every phone file. (I will maybe dump some of them in the case that they get lost in time)

# Supported devices (yet) :
* Cisco 7940/7960
* Cisco 7911/7906
